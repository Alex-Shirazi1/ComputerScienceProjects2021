# ComputerScienceProjects2021
These are some of my projects ive developed this year. They include a photo web appication that allows you to make accounts, photo posts and comments using mysql, a virtual file system coded in c for linux, and a full stack react app with a java backend and mongodb that acts as a listing app.
